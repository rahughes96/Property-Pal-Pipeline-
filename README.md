# Property-Pal-Pipeline-
AiCore project 2

Milestone 1
The webpage I chose to scrape is PropertyPal.com, a platform to view local properties for sale and rent. By using the selenium package and Webdriver, PropertyPal has a vast quantity of retrievable data. Every property has a host of information we can scrape including location, size, No. of bedrooms etc.
